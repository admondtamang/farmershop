## Introduction
Today, farmers feed 6 billion people. However, some 800 million people go to bed hungry every night and 166 million children are malnourished. At the same time, current agricultural practices are responsible for dead zones at the mouths of the world’s rivers and rapid species extinctions. By 2050, the human population will grow by two to three billion. The challenge for agriculture is not only producing more food but producing it in a sustainable manner while raising living standards for the poor, many of whom live and work in rural areas. All this must be done while dealing with the uncertain consequences of global warming and geopolitics. The solutions will include new policies, new technologies, and new production practices” 
For some companies, if budget and resources are enough to have two development team working in same project with different programming language in the native environment of each platform. The native development gives advantage of developing user interface close to the platform. But the code base isn’t sharable. The iOS team cannot use the code written by android team and when some features arrive in android then we must wait for iOS to deliver the update. So, the application or user interface may differ from each other. There is always two separate code base which is separately maintained
